   <p>
      Cromite is a Chromium fork based on Bromite with built-in support for ad blocking and an eye for privacy.
   </p>
   <p>
      Cromite's goal is to
      <ul>
        <li>limit the features built into the browser that can be used as a platform for tracking users' habits, and, if it is not technically possible, disable them and leave it up to the user to choose whether to re-enable them</li>
        <li>limit the close integration between the browser and its manufacturer</li>
        <li>not let the excellent research work done by csagan5 with Bromite be lost</li>
      </ul>
   </p>
